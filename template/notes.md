### Node.JS

So far, we’ve used the _JavaScript_ language in a single environment: the browser. This chapter and the 
next one will briefly introduce _Node.js_, a program that allows you to apply your JavaScript skills outside 
of the browser. With it, you can build anything from small command line tools to _HTTP servers_ that power 
dynamic websites.

These chapters aim to teach you the main concepts that _Node.js_ uses and to give you enough information to 
write useful programs for it. They do not try to be a complete, or even a thorough, treatment of the platform.

Whereas you could run the code in previous chapters directly on these pages, because it was either raw JavaScript 
or written for the browser, the code samples in this chapter are written for Node and often won’t run in the browser.
