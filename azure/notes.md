Azure Event Hubs is a native data-streaming service in the cloud that can stream millions of events per second, with low 
latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka. It enables you to run existing 
Kafka workloads without any code changes.

efficiency and customer experience.
